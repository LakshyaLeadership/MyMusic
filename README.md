# MyMusic: A C# Microservices-Based Music Library Showcase

Welcome to MyMusic, a testament to my commitment to clean architecture, robust design, and modern C# development practices. This project is not just a functional music library; it's a showcase of my ability to build scalable, maintainable, and testable applications.

## Why MyMusic Stands Out

* **Microservices Architecture:**  Embraces the flexibility and scalability of microservices, breaking down the application into discrete, independently deployable components. This approach improves fault tolerance, simplifies development, and enables easier scaling of specific services.

* **Dual Data Access Strategies:** Demonstrates proficiency with both Entity Framework Core Code-First and Database-First approaches. This highlights my adaptability in choosing the right tool for the job, whether it's rapidly prototyping a data model or working with an existing database schema.

* **Dependency Injection (DI):** Employs Autofac, a powerful DI container, to manage dependencies throughout the application. This leads to loosely coupled components, improved testability, and easier maintenance as the project grows.

* **Thorough Testing:** Features a comprehensive suite of tests using XUnit, NUnit, and MSTest. This demonstrates my commitment to quality assurance, ensuring the codebase is reliable and functions as intended.

* **Clean Code Principles:** Adherence to SOLID principles, clear naming conventions, and well-structured code make the project a pleasure to work with and easy to extend.

## Technical Deep Dive

### MyMusic.Api:
The API layer is the gateway to the music library, exposing RESTful endpoints for all interactions. It handles request validation, authentication (if implemented), and routing to the appropriate services. The API is designed to be lightweight and focused on providing a clear interface for clients.

### MyMusic.EFCoreCodeFirst & MyMusic.EFCoreDbFirst:
These projects represent the two primary data access strategies:

* **Code-First:** Ideal for rapid prototyping and scenarios where the data model evolves alongside the application. The code defines the model, and Entity Framework generates the database schema.

* **Database-First:** Well-suited for situations where you're working with an existing database. Entity Framework generates model classes based on the database schema.

### MyMusic.Repositories:
Repositories encapsulate the data access logic, providing a clean abstraction layer over the database. This keeps the business logic in the services layer separate from the underlying data storage technology, making it easier to switch databases or adapt to changing requirements.

### MyMusic.Services:
Services implement the core business logic of the application. They orchestrate interactions with repositories, handle validation, and perform any necessary transformations on the data. Services are the heart of the application, where the rules and processes of the music library come to life.

### MyMusic.ViewModels:
ViewModels act as data transfer objects (DTOs) between the API and clients. They shape the data in a way that's most convenient for presentation, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### MyMusic.*Test:
Each layer of the application has corresponding test projects, showcasing the use of different testing frameworks. This multi-pronged approach ensures thorough coverage and validates the functionality of each component.

## My Expertise in Action

* **SOLID Principles:** I have designed the architecture with a focus on the SOLID principles, ensuring the code is flexible, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes.
* **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** I follow a TDD approach, writing tests before code, which helps me clarify requirements, catch errors early, and build a solid foundation for the application.
* **Clean Code Practices:** I believe that clean code is essential for collaboration and long-term success. You'll find that my code is well-organized, self-documenting, and easy to understand.
